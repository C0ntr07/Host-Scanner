# Host Scanner Data

This folder contains the data which the application may use for various features.

See the [Host-Scanner-Scripts](https://github.com/RoliSoft/Host-Scanner-Scripts) repository for a list of file types and currently implemented data generator scripts.

The `download.sh` script will download an older snapshot of the data files for testing purposes. To get newer data, see the aforementioned repository for generation instructions.
